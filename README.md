Purpose:

The project aims to provide definitions, synonyms, and antonyms for a given word using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library's WordNet module.
Components:

Class Dictionar: This class encapsulates methods to fetch and display information about a word.
Defination(word): Fetches definitions for the input word using WordNet's synsets.
Synonyms(word): Retrieves synonyms for the input word from its synsets.
Antonyms(word): Fetches antonyms for the input word using the synsets in WordNet.
main(): This method is currently not implemented fully in the provided code. It's intended to take user input and call the other methods to display information about the word.
WordNet:

WordNet is a large lexical database of English. It groups words into sets of synonyms (synsets) and provides short, general definitions for these sets.
Functionality:

Definitions: Prints out definitions of the input word if available.
Synonyms: Prints out synonyms of the input word excluding the word itself.
Antonyms: Prints out antonyms of the input word if available.
Execution:

When the script is run (if __name__ == "__main__": block), it prompts the user to enter a word.
It then calls the Defination, Synonyms, and Antonyms methods of the Dictionar class to fetch and display the respective information.
Improvements and Considerations:
Error Handling: Add error handling to manage cases where the word entered may not have definitions, synonyms, or antonyms.
User Interface: Implement a proper interactive user interface in main() to guide users through input and output.
Efficiency: Currently, the code might be redundant in fetching synonyms and antonyms separately for each synset. Consider optimizing this.
Documentation: Add comments and docstrings to clarify each method's purpose and usage.
Expansion: Consider adding more features like hypernyms, hyponyms, examples, etc., provided by WordNet.

Conclusion:
This project leverages NLTK's WordNet to provide lexical information (definitions, synonyms, and antonyms) for a given word. It's a basic yet practical example of using natural language processing tools for word sense disambiguation and lexical resource retrieval.
